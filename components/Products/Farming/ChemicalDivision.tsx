              <br />
              Located in the serene village of Thalarapadi near Cheyyar, Risa
              Farm is a vibrant and diverse agricultural haven dedicated to
              sustainable farming practices and quality produce. Spread across
              lush green landscapes, our farm is more than just a piece of land
              â€” it's a living, breathing ecosystem where crops, cattle, poultry,
              and people thrive in harmony.
