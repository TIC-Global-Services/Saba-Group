             Established in 2008, we are a highly efficient manufacturer of Crushed Stone Sand (M-Sand) for Concrete, Plaster Sand (P-Sand) for Plastering, and Construction Aggregates, located near Walajahpet, just 3 km off the Bangaloreâ€“Chennai Expressway. Our two state-of-the-art crushing units feature a 4-stage crushing process, enabling us to crush up to 700 tons per hour. Because our raw material is sourced from our own mines, we ensure consistent quality standards from start to finish.
